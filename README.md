# Phantom
Control your car's steering and movement from an app with openpilot. Designed to be a gimmick feature more than anything. It's a mock Tesla Summon.

Download the app [here](https://github.com/ShaneSmiskol/phantom-app/blob/master/phantom-app.apk?raw=true).

This is now outdated and only works on openpilot 0.5.12 (branch release2) on [Arne's fork here](https://github.com/arne182/openpilot).
